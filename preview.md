In this preview, I am showing different sounds that I have compiled, and edited in order to get a desired effect. There is one sound of something simmering, in which I did a low and high pass filter in order to achieve the desired effect. The next sound that I have is what I hope will sound like cutting. Ideally, it should cut slower and slower, each time that the cutting board is emptied into the bowl, however, I don't really have the sound of the bowl correct yet, therefore there is a problem with the sound.
