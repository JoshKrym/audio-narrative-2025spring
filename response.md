My project was supposed to be about cooking, and what it meant to me. For me, cooking is a break from my normal routine of constant studying and working. I feel that it destresses me, for a period of time. At first, I wanted to convey this in my piece by creating a sort of beat/song, made up of different parts of the cooking process. Initially, the beat would be very fast paced, and then it would slowly decrease throughtout the song, until all it was slow and calm. I wanted to use repetition to make this happen. Each sound would repeat at a certain beat. I initally thought that this would be very challenging, not only because I have little experience with audacity, but also almost no knowledge of music theory. I initially wanted to use autotune to make the sounds work together, as well as to vary them so they were not as repetitive. However, I was not able to figure out how to get autotune to work, so, I dropped that idea. That as well as my schedule starting to take more time than I had available led to me eventually completely dropping my idea, however, I eventually decided to try and keep the spirit of my inital work alive.
I was not very interested in keeping the project as a realistic portrayal of cooking, rather I just wanted to keep what was relevant for the audio narrative. I saw feedback that suggested that I should include more parts of the cooking process, *Insert Screenshot here*, however I ultimately decided to reject this feedback simply because it did not fit with my rhythm for this project. I felt that simply cutting passed the parts that I did not need or did not fit would be better, despite the potential narrative discontinuity. I felt that much of the feedback that I got, was about me trying to make this piece more realistic to someone that was actually cooking, rather than my experience when cooking. While the piece involved me cooking, I thought that it was more supposed to be about stress, and how I cope with it by cooking. This is why there is a large absence of music, as for me, when I am stressed, it largely feels like I am trapped in my own head, and as such, while I do listen to music while cooking, it doesn't sound like that to me. I still experimented with some music, but it largely sounded like it was distracting to much from what I was trying to say, and gave the listener an escape from there head. There were parts of my feedback that I did take, especially since I did agree with it. I felt as though, most of the sounds in which I was trying to repeat, just sounded plain bad, and people were having trouble understanding what was happening because of it. For instance, in the beginning, the typing on the keyboard, was initially a looped sound that I found online, but I ultimately discarded it because people didn't realize that it was typing. At this point I had also given up hope of making it more musical and nature, and instead replaced it with a sound of me typing faster and faster to try to portray the stress, and I think that it came out okay, however, I was unable to receive feedback on this change.
While I did not have music, I did have some background noise. The first was a sort of surreal sound that I felt helped with the empty, stressful feeling that I wanted. Then I also found another sound that was more musical in nature, and that felt more upbeat, while not being a straight song, that I felt fit with the peaceful nature that I was hoping for at the end of the narrative.
There were originally many more sounds, and they were also much longer. They were longer because I was more focussed on just trying to get them right, rather than adjusting the length, as they were originally supposed to merge together and change in different dynamic ways, however in my final version of the piece, I ultimately shortened all of the sounds and decided on having a much more sequential narrative.
Some advice that I took, was of making people move towards the kitchen. I added that because I thought it helped with the transition from the keyboard to the cooking, quite well, as there was originally just silence, and thunder.
