# Cooking in a Storm
## Description
This is an audio narrative about someone who is initially typing on their keyboard during a storm. Due to the heavy amount of work they are doing, they get up and go to the fridge to start cooking to relieve some stress. They start chopping, ingredients from the fridge to get ready to cook. They then pour the ingredients into a pot, and then pour water into the pot, and start boiling it to make the food. Around halfway through cutting, the storm stops and birds come out. After the water finishes boiling they go back to typing, and working, now slower and more relaxed. Please check out this project and let me know what you think!
